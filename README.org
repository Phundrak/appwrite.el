* How complete is this SDK anyways?
~appwrite.el~ is currently in its infancy, so donâ€™t expect yet most of
the functionalities to be available. If you want to see a detailed
view of the parity between this library and the server API, check out
the [[file:TODOs.org][TODOs]] file in this repository.

* Installation
** Manual Installation
To manually install ~appwrite.el~, clone the repository wherever you
want, then put the path to the repository in your ~load-path~. You can
then require it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/your/appwrite.el/")
(require 'appwrite)
#+end_src

** Straight + use-package
You can also let straight with use-package manage the git repository
themselves. For that, you can use this as your minimal config for
installing ~appwrite.el~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package appwrite
  :straight (appwrite :git host
                      :repo "https://labs.phundrak.com/phundrak/appwrite.el"))
#+end_src
